# TinyApp
LHL Web Dev Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs like bit.ly or tiny.url! This app has user logins and user-specific links, and has a *dark-mode theme*.

# Server Setup and Information

For first time setup, use the following commands: 

```
npm install
npm run tinyappsetup
npm run tinyapp 
```
After, you can simply run the server with: 
```
npm run tinyapp
```

If your server databases ever break, you can run ``npm run tinyappsetup`` again and it will clean them. Do not do this again if you like your databases, back them up even. **:)**

### Server Features:

* **User PWs are hashed**
* **Cookies are encrypted**
* **_Server runs off local json files which are created on setup, preserving state!_**
* Constants are easy to customize in the constants.js folder
* For devs, there are some debug functions built in.
* Server sends html in a darkmode, so you can feel *superior* over lightmode tinyApps.
